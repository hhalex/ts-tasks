# [WIP] Minimal stream and task abstractions in Typescript

Small set of primitives to handle asynchronicity, in a functional way.

This library aims at being totally modular, you could choose to only use the primitives you want. The purpose is to only import the code you really use, and not the whole library.

- functional
- strongly typed
- lightweight, primtives you don't use are tree shaked
